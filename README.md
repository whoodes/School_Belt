This is a simple javaFX program that incorporates the simple calculator and
text editor from my other repos.

Both the CalculatorFX and TextEditorFX have been cleaned up and restructured
to be utilized as objects by the SchoolBelt Class.

Features I intend to add, include:
- A quadratic formula calculator
- A simple mathematic expression evaluator, e.g., 5 + (6 -2) / (2 + 2)
- A loan calculator

As well as other useful little tools I can think of.

The idea for this came about by wanting a fun one-stop-shop for simple tasks,
while still being plausible for a 1st to 2nd year CS major.
